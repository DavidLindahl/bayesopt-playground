# Bayesian Optimization â€” Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Bayesian Optimization**, a sample-efficient technique for optimizing expensive or unknown black-box functions.

Bayesian Optimization uses:
- A **surrogate model** (commonly a Gaussian Process) to approximate the objective function.
- An **acquisition function** to decide where to sample next (e.g., Expected Improvement, UCB).

---

## Key Features
- Gaussian Process regression for function approximation.
- Multiple acquisition functions to guide exploration vs. exploitation.
- Example scripts demonstrating optimization of non-trivial functions.
- Visualizations for understanding the optimization process.

---

## Example Use Case
```python
# Example: Optimize a noisy 1D function
from bayes_opt import BayesianOptimization

def black_box_function(x):
    return -x**2 + 4

optimizer = BayesianOptimization(
    f=black_box_function,
    pbounds={'x': (-3, 3)},
    random_state=42
)

optimizer.maximize(
    init_points=2,
    n_iter=10
)

print(optimizer.max)
````
